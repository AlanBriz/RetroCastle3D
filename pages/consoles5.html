    <p> Super Mario 64 is a groundbreaking 3D platformer that redefined the genre, bringing Mario into a fully explorable world for the first time. As Mario, players journey through Princess Peach’s castle, leaping into magical paintings to explore diverse worlds filled with platforming challenges, puzzles, and enemies. </p>

    <p> Tasked with collecting Power Stars to defeat Bowser and rescue the princess, Mario utilizes a fluid and dynamic moveset, including triple jumps, wall kicks, and long jumps, all within expansive, open-ended levels. With its revolutionary camera system, precise controls, and imaginative level design, Super Mario 64 set the standard for 3D platforming and remains one of the most influential games of all time.</p>
