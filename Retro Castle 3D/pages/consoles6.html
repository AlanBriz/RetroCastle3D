    <p> Resident Evil 4 revolutionized the survival horror genre with its over-the-shoulder perspective, intense action, and dynamic enemy encounters. Players take on the role of Leon S. Kennedy, a government agent sent to a remote European village to rescue the president’s kidnapped daughter, Ashley Graham.  </p>

    <p> What begins as a simple mission quickly spirals into terror as Leon faces the fanatical cult known as Los Illuminados and their parasitic creations, the Ganados. With tight gunplay, resource management, and pulse-pounding set pieces, Resident Evil 4 masterfully blends horror and action, cementing itself as one of the most influential games of all time.</p>
