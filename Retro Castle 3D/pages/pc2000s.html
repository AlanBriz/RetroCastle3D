      <br>
      <p>As technology advanced, so did the scope of 3D gaming on PC. The early 2000s brought photo-realistic textures, physics engines, and vast open worlds. MMORPGs like World of Warcraft connected millions, while shooters like Half-Life 2 and RPGs like Morrowind redefined storytelling. This was the age where PCs took the lead in delivering high-fidelity, limitless gaming experiences.
